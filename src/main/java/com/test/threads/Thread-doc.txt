Application:
	An application is a program which will perform the specific task. 
	For example google chrome,MS word, Paint etc.

Process:
	Process is executable instance of the application. For example if double click MS word 
	icon then it will start the process internally that starts the MS word. 
		1.Each process will take separate memory address in computer.
		2.Communication between the process(interprocess communication) takes more time
		3.Context switching from one process to another is more expensive
