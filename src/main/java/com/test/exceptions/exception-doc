Exception Handling In Java
-----------------------------


1.If super class method is not throwing any exceptions, then it can be overrided
  with any unchecked type of exceptions, but can not be overrided with checked type of exceptions.
  
2.If a super class method is throwing unchecked exception, then it can be overrided 
  in the sub class with same exception or any other unchecked exceptions but can not be overrided 
  with checked exceptions.
  
  
3.If super class method is throwing checked type of exception, then it can be overrided with same 
exception or with it’s sub class exceptions i.e you can decrease the scope of the exception, 
but can not be overrided with it’s super class exceptions i.e you can not increase the scope of the exception.
